# SmartDraft Extension Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. "A listener indicated an asynchronous response by returning true, but the message channel closed before a response was received"

**Problem**: This error occurs when the background script doesn't properly handle async operations.

**Solution**: 
- The latest version has been fixed with proper async handling
- Reload the extension: Go to `chrome://extensions/`, find SmartDraft, and click the reload button
- If the issue persists, check the console for additional error messages

### 2. Extension Won't Load - Permission Errors

**Problem**: `Permission 'https://mail.google.com/*' is unknown`

**Solution**: 
- This has been fixed in the latest manifest.json
- URL permissions are now properly placed in `host_permissions`
- Reload the extension after updating

### 3. Infinite Loading When Generating Email

**Problem**: The "Generating your email with AI..." message appears indefinitely.

**Solutions**:
- **Check API Key**: Ensure your OpenAI API key is valid and has credits
- **Network Issues**: Check your internet connection
- **Timeout**: The system now has a 30-second timeout - if it takes longer, try again
- **API Limits**: You may have hit OpenAI's rate limits - wait a few minutes

### 4. Gmail Integration Not Working

**Problem**: SmartDraft buttons don't appear in Gmail.

**Solutions**:
- **Refresh Gmail**: Reload the Gmail page
- **Check URL**: Ensure you're on `mail.google.com` or `gmail.com`
- **Wait for Load**: Gmail takes time to load - wait 10-15 seconds after page load
- **Clear Cache**: Clear browser cache and reload

### 5. API Key Issues

**Problem**: "OpenAI API key not configured" or API errors.

**Solutions**:
- **Get Valid Key**: Get a new API key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
- **Check Format**: API keys start with `sk-`
- **Test Connection**: Use the "Test API Connection" button in settings
- **Check Credits**: Ensure your OpenAI account has available credits

### 6. Extension Popup Not Opening

**Problem**: Clicking the extension icon does nothing.

**Solutions**:
- **Check Console**: Open Developer Tools and check for errors
