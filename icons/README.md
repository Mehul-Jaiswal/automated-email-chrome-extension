# Icons Directory

This directory should contain the following icon files for the SmartDraft Chrome Extension:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixel icon for the extension
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixel icon for the extension
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixel icon for the extension

## Creating Icons

You can create these icons using any image editing software. The icons should:

1. **Be square** (same width and height)
2. **Have a transparent background**
3. **Use the SmartDraft branding colors** (blue #1a73e8)
4. **Include a recognizable symbol** like:
   - A document with AI/brain symbol
   - An envelope with a sparkle/star
   - A pen with AI elements

## Recommended Icon Design

The icon should represent:
- Email/document creation
- AI assistance
- Professional appearance

## File Formats

- Use PNG format for transparency support
- Ensure crisp edges at all sizes
- Test icons at different sizes to ensure readability

## Temporary Solution

Until proper icons are created, you can:
1. Use any 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 PNG files as placeholders
2. Create simple colored squares with the extension colors
3. Use online icon generators to create basic icons

The extension will work without custom icons, but Chrome will use default placeholder icons.
